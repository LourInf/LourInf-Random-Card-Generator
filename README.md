### Main learnings:

1. **Global Variable:** remember that if it's declared locally it cannot be later used by different functions. In this case, the variable `timer` is declared globally to be accessible by both the `setTimer` and `stopTimer` functions.

2. **setTimeout:** to set a delay before using a function.
   
3. **clearTimeout:** to stop the execution of a function scheduled by setTimeout, preventing its repetition.
   
4. **Click Event Listeners:** to respond to the click of the user on each buttom triggering some function after the click.

5. **Dynamic Content Generation:** use functions to dynamically generate content for HTML, in this case, random card numbers, suits, and style.
  
6. **Ternary Operator:** use of ternary operator instead of if else as a more concise conditional assignment.
